#1.7 The statistical forecasting perspective

The thing we are trying to forecast is unknown (or we wouldn't be
forecasting it), and so we can think of it as a *random variable*. For
example, the total sales for next month could take a range of possible
values, and until we add up the actual sales at the end of the month we don't
know what the value will be. So, until we know the sales for next month,
it is a random quantity. 

Because next month is relatively close, we
usually have a good idea what the likely sales values could be. On the
other hand, if we are forecasting the sales for the same month next
year, the possible values it could take are much more variable. In most
forecasting situations, the variation associated with the thing we are
forecasting will shrink as the event approaches. In other words, the
further ahead we forecast, the more uncertain we are. 

When we obtain a forecast, we are estimating the *middle* of the range of possible values
the random variable could take. Very often, a forecast is accompanied by
a prediction interval giving a *range* of values the random variable
could take with relatively high probability. For example, a 95%
prediction interval contains a range of values which should include the
actual future value with probability 95%. 

A forecast is always based on some observations. Suppose we denote all the information we have
observed as ${\cal I}$ and we want to forecast $y_i$. We then
write $y_{i} |{\cal I}$ meaning "the random variable $y_{i}$
given what we know in ${\cal I}$". The set  of values that this random variable
could take, along with their relative probabilities, is known as the "probability distribution" of $y_{i} |{\cal I}$. In forecasting,
we call this the "forecast distribution". When we talk about the "forecast", we usually mean the average value of the forecast
distribution, and we put a "hat" over $y$ to show this. Thus, we
write the forecast of $y_i$ as $\hat{y}\_i$, meaning the average of
the possible values that $y_i$ could take given everything we know.
Occasionally, we will use $\hat{y}\_i$ to refer to the *median* (or
middle value) of the forecast distribution instead.

With time series forecasting, it is often useful to specify exactly what information we
have used in calculating the forecast. Then we will write, for example,
$\hat{y}_{t|t-1}$ to mean the forecast of $y_t$ taking account of
all previous observations $(y_1,\dots,y_{t-1})$. Similarly,
$\hat{y}_{T+h|T}$ means the forecast of $y_{T+h}$ taking account
of $y_1,\dots,y_T$ (i.e., an $h$-step forecast taking account of
all observations up to time $T$).
