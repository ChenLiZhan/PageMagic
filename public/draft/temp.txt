#1.4 Forecasting data and methods

The appropriate forecasting methods depend largely on what data are available. 

If there are no data available, or if the data available are not relevant to the
forecasts, then **qualitative forecasting** methods must be used. These
methods are not purely guesswork---there are well-developed structured
approaches to obtaining good forecasts without using historical data.
These methods are discussed in [Chapter 3](http://otexts.com/fpp/3).

**Quantitative forecasting** can be applied when two conditions are
satisfied:

1.  numerical information about the past is available;
2.  it is reasonable to assume that some aspects of the past patterns
    will continue into the future.

There is a wide range of quantitative forecasting methods, often
developed within specific disciplines for specific purposes. Each method
has its own properties, accuracies, and costs that must be considered
when choosing a specific method. Most quantitative forecasting problems
use either time series data (collected at regular intervals over time)
or cross-sectional data (collected at a single point in time).

Cross-sectional forecasting
---------------------------

With cross-sectional data, we are wanting to predict the value of
something we have not observed, using the information on the cases that
we have observed. Examples of cross-sectional data include:

-   House prices for all houses sold in 2011 in a particular area. We
    are interested in predicting the price of a house not in our data
    set using various house characteristics: position, no. bedrooms, age, etc.
-   Fuel economy data for a range of 2009 model cars. We are interested
    in predicting the carbon footprint of a vehicle not in our data set
    using information such as the size of the engine and the fuel
    efficiency of the car.

Example 1.1 Car emissions
-------------------------

Table 1.1 gives some data on 2009 model cars, each of which has an
automatic transmission, four cylinders and an engine size under 2
liters.

the highway.

A forecaster may wish to predict the carbon footprint (tons of
CO<sub>2</sub> per year) for other similar vehicles that are not included in the
above table. It is necessary to first estimate the effects of the
predictors (number of cylinders, size of engine, and fuel economy) on
the variable to be forecast (carbon footprint). Then, provided that we know the predictors for a car not in the table, we can forecast its carbon
footprint. 

Cross-sectional models are used when the variable to be
forecast exhibits a relationship with one or more other predictor
variables.&nbsp;The purpose of the cross-sectional model is to describe the
form of the relationship and use it to forecast values of the forecast
variable that have not been observed. Under this model, any change in
predictors will affect the output of the system in a predictable way,
assuming that the relationship does not change. Models in this class
include regression models, additive models, and some kinds of neural
networks. These models are discussed in Chapters
[4](http://otexts.com/fpp/4), [5](http://otexts.com/fpp/5) and
[9](http://otexts.com/fpp/9/). 

Some people use the term "predict" for
cross-sectional data and "forecast" for time series data (see below). In
this book, we will not make this distinction---we will use the words
interchangeably.

Time series forecasting
-----------------------

Time series data are useful when you are forecasting something that is
changing over time (e.g., stock prices, sales figures, profits, etc.).
Examples of time series data include:

-   Daily IBM stock prices
-   Monthly rainfall
-   Quarterly sales results for Amazon
-   Annual Google profits

Anything that is observed sequentially over time is a time series. In
this book, we will only consider time series that are observed at
regular intervals of time (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, monthly,
quarterly, annually). Irregularly spaced time series can also occur, but
are beyond the scope of this book. 

When forecasting time series data, the aim is to estimate how the sequence of observations will continue
into the future. The following figure shows the quarterly Australian beer
production from 1992 to the third quarter of 2008. 

[caption id="attachment_367" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Figure 1.1: Australian quarterly beer production: 1992Q1--2008Q3, with two years of forecasts."]<img class="size-full wp-image-318" src="http://www.otexts.org/sites/default/files/fpp/images/beerf2.png" alt="" width="570">[/caption]

The blue lines show forecasts for the next two years. Notice how the
forecasts have captured the seasonal pattern seen in the historical data
and replicated it for the next two years. The dark shaded region shows
80% prediction intervals. That is, each future value is expected to lie
in the dark blue region with a probability of 80%. The light shaded
region shows 95% prediction intervals. These prediction intervals are a
very useful way of displaying the uncertainty in forecasts. In this
case, the forecasts are expected to be very accurate, hence the
prediction intervals are quite narrow. 

Time series forecasting uses only information on the variable to be forecast, and makes no attempt to
discover the factors which affect its behavior. Therefore it will extrapolate
trend and seasonal patterns, but it ignores all other information such
as marketing initiatives, competitor activity, changes in economic
conditions, and so on. 

Time series models used for forecasting include
ARIMA models, exponential smoothing and structural models. These models
are discussed in Chapters [6](http://otexts.com/fpp/6),
[7](http://otexts.com/fpp/7) and [8](http://otexts.com/fpp/8).

Predictor variables and time series forecasting
-----------------------------------------------

Predictor variables can also be used in time series forecasting. For
example, suppose we wish to forecast the hourly electricity demand (ED)
of a hot region during the summer period. A model with predictor
variables might be of the form 

\begin{align\*} \text{ED} = &amp; f(\text{current temperature, strength of economy, population,}\\\\ &amp;
\qquad \text{time of day, day of week, error}). \end{align\*} 

The relationship is not exact---there will always be changes in electricity
demand that cannot be accounted for by the predictor variables. The
“error” term on the right allows for random variation and the effects of
relevant variables that are not included in the model. We call this an
“explanatory model” because it helps explain what causes the variation
in electricity demand. 

Because the electricity demand data form a time
series, we could also use a time series model for forecasting. In this
case, a suitable time series forecasting equation is of the form 

<div>
$$ \text{ED}_{t+1} = f(\text{ED}_{t}, \text{ED}_{t-1}, \text{ED}_{t-2}, \text{ED}_{t-3},\dots, \text{error}), $$
</div>

where $t$ is the present hour, $t+1$ is the next hour, $t-1$ is the
previous hour, $t-2$ is two hours ago, and so on. Here, prediction of
the future is based on past values of a variable, but not on external
variables which may affect the system. Again, the "error" term on the
right allows for random variation and the effects of relevant variables that are
not included in the model. 

There is also a third type of model which combines the features of the above two models. For example, it might be given by

<div> $$ \text{ED}_{t+1} = f(\text{ED}_{t}, \text{current temperature, time of day, day of week, error}). $$ </div>

These types of mixed models have been given various names in different disciplines. They are known as
dynamic regression models, panel data models, longitudinal models,
transfer function models, and linear system models (assuming $f$ is
linear). These models are discussed in Chapter
[9](http://otexts.com/fpp/9). 

An explanatory model is very useful because it incorporates information about other variables, rather than
only historical values of the variable to be forecast. However, there
are several reasons a forecaster might select a time series model rather
than an explanatory model. First, the system may not be understood, and
even if it was understood it may be extremely difficult to measure the
relationships that are assumed to govern its behavior. Second, it is necessary to
know or forecast the various predictors in order to be able to forecast
the variable of interest, and this may be too difficult. Third, the main
concern may be only to predict what will happen, not to know why it
happens. Finally, the time series model may give more accurate forecasts
than an explanatory or mixed model. 

The model to be used in forecasting depends on the resources and data available, the accuracy of the
competing models, and how the forecasting model is to be used.

Notation
--------

For cross-sectional data, we will use the subscript $i$ to indicate a
specific observation. For example, $y_i$ will denote the $i$th
observation in a data set. We will also use $N$ to denote the total
number of observations in the data set. For time series data, we will
use the subscript $t$ instead of $i$. For example, $y_t$ will
denote the observation at time $t$. We will use $T$ to denote the
number of observations in a time series. When we are making general
comments that could be applicable to either cross-sectional or time series
data, we will tend to use $i$ and $N$.
